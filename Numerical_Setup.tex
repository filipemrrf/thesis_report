\chapter{Numerical Setup}
\label{chapter:numerical_setup}

In this chapter, we will describe the numerical setup of the \texttt{bamps} code. We will start by discussing the grid setup in section \ref{section:grid}, followed by the numerical method used to solve the partial differential equation systems in section \ref{section:Numerical_Method}. Finally, we will discuss the adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) strategy employed in \texttt{bamps} in section \ref{section:amr}.
