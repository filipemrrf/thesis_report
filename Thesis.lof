\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.1}{\ignorespaces Geometric definition of the lapse function $\alpha $ and the shift vector $\beta ^i$. The lapse function $\alpha $ is the proper time between two adjacent hypersurfaces $\Sigma _t$ and $\Sigma _{t+dt}$ measured by \textit {Eulerian observers}. The shift vector $\beta ^i$ is the relative velocity between the \textit {Eulerian observers} and the lines of constant spatial coordinates. \cite {Introduction_to_3+1_numerical_relativity}}}{6}{figure.caption.8}%

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3.1}{\ignorespaces Two-dimensional sketch of the bamps cubed-ball grid layout. The grid is composed of several patches shaped like deformed cubes. These patches can be further divided into subpatches. Each subpatch is covered by Gauss-Lobatto grids. \cite {Pseudospectral_method_for_gravitational_wave_collapse}}}{14}{figure.caption.9}%
