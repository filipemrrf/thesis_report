The lapse function $\alpha $ is the proper time between two adjacent hypersurfaces $\Sigma _t$ and $\Sigma _{t+dt}$ measured by \textit {Eulerian observers}. The shift vector $\beta ^i$ is the relative velocity between the \textit {Eulerian observers} and the lines of constant spatial coordinates. \cite {Introduction_to_3+1_numerical_relativity}}}{8}{figure.caption.11}%

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3.1}{\ignorespaces Two-dimensional sketch of the \texttt {bamps} cubed-ball grid layout. The grid is composed of several patches shaped like deformed cubes. These patches can be further divided into subpatches. Each subpatch is covered by Gauss-Lobatto grids. \cite {Pseudospectral_method_for_gravitational_wave_collapse}}}{16}{figure.caption.12}%
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3.2}{\ignorespaces Example of a grid that does not satisfy the constraints for a 'legal' \texttt {bamps} grid (left) and the same grid after the modification of the h-refinement flags to obey these constraints (right). In a 'legal' \texttt {bamps} grid, each subpatch is not allowed to be more than one refinement level apart from any of its neighbors, and the grid structure must satisfy a 1:2 condition. Thus, if a subpatch is refined, all its neighbors must either be at the same refinement level or one level coarser. This change in refinement level is made to ensure that the grid structure remains consistent and that the numerical methods used in \texttt {bamps} can operate correctly across patch boundaries \cite {Adaptive_hp_refinement_for_spectral_elements_in_numerical_relativity}.}}{20}{figure.caption.13}%
